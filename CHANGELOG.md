- Add controlled email-link confirmation with explicit awaited actions, and invitation-code resend with a shared pending lock and server cooldown.
- Allow notification activation to return `false` without dismissing the menu or reporting a failure.

- Add optional `titleOverflow="truncate"` to page patterns for a shrinking title and fixed-width actions on one row, retaining the wrapping default.
- Return API-key confirmation focus to its connected Revoke action after native table row or cell restoration.
- Keep ordinary query loading announcements visually hidden while retaining accessible status and explicit visible progress.
- Prevent repeated code-copy presses while a clipboard write is pending, with toast feedback and retry after failure.
- Discover browser regressions through one shared suite and reuse fixture serving, browser setup, and cleanup.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-10-06

- Expose matching internal primary navigation links as the current page, with the same section boundaries and preserved child routes as visual selection.
- Await app-owned notification activation with duplicate request protection, toast-only failures, pending announcements, and retry/pagination composition slots. Use “Mark all as read” for the default header action.

- Report clipboard success and failure through toasts with a stable copy action, and explain session revocation consequences.
- Keep toast close controls visible and reachable on touch and keyboard, with 32px targets on frontmost/expanded rows while hidden and exiting rows stay inactive. Restore initiating control focus when native final-toast dismissal leaves focus on the document body.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-10-06

- Restore full-width section dividers in the sidebar account menu while retaining padded labels and actions.
- Standardize bottom-center toasts and toast-only submission failures across forms, dialogs, confirmations, and shared mutation actions. Preserve drafts and keep dialogs open for retry; inline field validation and load/policy errors remain separate.
- Shared email/password settings, expanded API-key metadata, authorized clients, and save-once API-key creation.
- Member account/security status, invitation management, and separate invite/add/edit dialogs.
- History tables, search/filter controls, event details, and a draft-based filter builder.
